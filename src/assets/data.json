            "synopsis": "<p>The first track on the album is a short clip from my 9th birthday party. It was during a period where we all decided to perform for each other, and one of the things I did was do a rap that many kids in Kenya (or Nairobi, at least) liked to do to feel like lyrical geniuses when I was growing up. The playful energy on this track is a preview of the energy I'm coming to this album with: I have things that I want to say, but I don't take myself too seriously as a rapper.</p><p>I decided against calling the track \"Intro\" or including that word in the title because I felt that would be generic; that dead horse has been flogged excessively throughout the music industry at this point, even just within Kenya.</p><p>The girl introducing me in the beginning is my half-aunt Ariane, and the other kids rapping and yelling alongside me are my brother Sidney and our old neighbours Eric and Jerry. Sido also makes a point to refer to me as \"Eclipse\" because he liked making fun of my big forehead, even though he's always had a fairly substantial one himself.</p>",

            "synopsis": "<p>While coming up with ideas for a follow-up to <em>Not a Rapper</em>, I liked the thought of creating a Part II for its title track, even though it's not exactly an original idea in the world of hip hop. I had really enjoyed writing that song after getting inspiration from Noel Miller and the boom bap tracks he's done like \"Motor Yola\", and I wanted to drop some more bars on another song with no central theme or subject matter.</p><p>Before I continue, I realise that on the surface, it's disingenuous of me to say that I'm not a rapper, while doing the very thing that rappers do. The whole idea is to say that I have no major aspirations as a musician; I'm simply doing this to try and entertain people, grow my brand, and because I have fun doing it.</p><p>At first, I had only written one verse to a beat I found on BeatStars, but when G'zay sent me the beat I asked him to make, my vision for the song came together quickly and I felt the need to write another one, which ended up being the first verse. Seeing as I simply wanted bars and more bars, G'zay was an easy pick for a feature given his pedigree as a lyricist in the Kenyan hip hop scene. The fact that he also made the beat made me feel he would give the song some extra care overall.</p><p>Vktor Mirage was also an easy decision because I'd previously worked with him on \"Nairobi Tofauti\", so I knew exactly what he'd bring to the table. I've followed him and his music for years, both as a solo artist and as a member of Masai Black Gold, since I got to know him and the group's other members through my brother from their high school days.</p><p>After Vktor and I recorded our verses in the studio, I felt the track was still missing something, so I decided to try an intro and outro with Emmanuel Kisiangani, a veteran comic and host/MC that I've gotten to know while doing stand-up. I wrote the intro for him, but he came up with the idea of rambling in the outro while we were in the studio; on top of being funny, I think it serves as a nice break from all the rapping before heading into the next track.</p>",

            "synopsis": "<p>This is one of five songs that weren't originally planned for this album, which I wrote in December 2021. It's a song I wrote as a recap of my year, from my entry into the Nairobi stand-up comedy scene in January to my third-place finish at the South Africa Regional Finals of the Tekken Online Challenge in December. When I came up with the idea, I thought it would go well with a slow afrobeats song, so that's what I set out for when I found the beat on Dagi's BeatStars profile.</p><p>I was inspired to include the voice note from my girlfriend Joan at the end after listening to \"Woman\" by Little Simz and \"My Little Love\" by Adele, off their critically acclaimed albums <em>Sometimes I Might Be Introvert</em> and <em>30</em>, respectively. \"Woman\" left a greater impression on me because of the variation in the music's arrangement during the outro while the voice note plays (I thought the voices in the middle were particularly cool). That gave me the idea of killing most of the drums halfway through Joan's voice note while humming the melody of the chorus, with the Maasai chants I sampled from the \"Only\" beat creeping in the background.</p><p>Speaking of that voice note, it's one Joan had actually sent me on WhatsApp, though I chopped it up a little bit to get rid of the bits irrelevant to the song while still making it sound natural. I was previously mulling over including voice notes I had sent to my brother while going through an episode of depression in the middle of the year, but after giving it some serious thought I felt it would take too much away from what's supposed to be a hopeful song, aside from making it way longer than it needed to be. When I later got the voice note from Joan, it was almost as if the universe knew exactly what the track needed, even though she was simply sending some love my way.</p>",

            "synopsis": "<p>This is a song I wrote for the project during the Covid-19 lockdown the Kenyan government imposed in March 2021, and it's my girlfriend Joan's favourite for obvious reasons. It's a conceptual sequel to \"Black Queen\" from <em>Not a Rapper</em>, in that I was exploring the feeling of meeting this woman for the first time and later getting into a relationship with her, whereas here I've become much fonder of her through our highs and lows together.</p><p>I hadn't really come up with the premise for the song until I heard the beat on KDaGreat's SoundCloud, and as I did the feelings and ideas just started coming naturally. I wrote the first verse and previewed it on my Instagram that same night in April 2021. Being of Rwandese origin, this song is also interesting in that I was able to collaborate with a producer from Burundi, who himself collaborated with a fellow Burundian artist to make the beat. Aside from the song being a tribute to my girlfriend, I see it as a testament to the creative talent coming out of the heart of Africa.</p><p>After I was done recording the song, I listened to it countless times feeling like it was missing something. I then decided to get someone in to add some background vocals just vibing throughout the entire song, and with that in mind I remembered a singer called Zippie that Joan had introduced me to not long before. I reached out to her and when she eventually came in, AndyBolo and I had her do three different takes that we could play around with. She did an amazing job and I'm glad I decided to get her involved; the song now had some feminine energy and some extra sauce on top of the main course.</p>",

It started with a concept I created using stems from the \"Only\" beat, while adding different drums to give it a completely different feel, even at the same tempo. I chopped up parts of the Maasai chants, reversed them and looped them throughout, save for the middle and the end of the song, then messed around with the rest of the stems until I landed on an arrangement I liked.</p><p>The drums I'd used were painfully basic, so when I took my concept to the studio, AndyBolo basically replicated my patterns with much better drums. I know I like to say I'm not a rapper, but I'm definitely not a producer, so the fact that we kept my original tambourine in the mix was a tiny win for me.</p><p>The subject matter for the song came to mind once I was done building out my concept. I had done a few videos on toxic masculinity on my social media before, so it didn't seem out of character for me to explore the same topic on my album, especially as it relates to the (mis)treatment of women following a song where I talk about one of the most important women in my life.</p><p>I pretty much wrote all the lyrics in about an hour, and while I was doing that, I remembered that Master Trail had done a video on toxic masculinity for their YouTube channel, so I went back and watched it to see if there were interesting bits I could sample. Once I did that, I reached out to KT, who I knew from primary school along with Luigi, to ask for the group's blessing and the guys were more than happy to give it.</p>",

It's a song where I'm gassing myself up and trying to sound cool on the beat, but I guess it also serves as a reminder that I'm not going to spend the entire album trying to be serious.</p><p>The hi-hat patterns that waytoolost used on this beat made for a groove I'd never quite heard on a drill beat before, and it put me in more of a light-hearted party mood the second I heard the drums come in for the first time. The hook is the first thing that came to mind while I was vibing to the beat, and I tried building out some funny situations around it to catch the attention of the listener: Who starts a song by asking you if your breath stinks?</p><p>Placing this song where I did made sense because it serves as a bit of a break from the intensity that had been rising from \"Twenny 21\" to \"Masculine\", while it's also followed by another drill track at the exact same tempo that brings back the intensity with its subject matter, and I feel like that allows <em>Substance</em> to end on a punchy note before moving into <em>Sippin' and Trippin'</em>.</p>",

With the rising cases of police brutality and all the scandals around procurement of PPE and other Covid-related materials for healthcare workers, I wanted to provide my own commentary on the struggles that many Kenyans were facing at the height of the pandemic to end <em>Substance</em> on a heavy note. I found the beat for this song the same night I found the beat for \"Simama Kando\", which was easy because both were produced by waytoolost.</p><p>One of the reasons I love this song is because it's full of fighting game references, which of course I would appreciate as an active member of the FGC (fighting game community). Even the title itself is a reference; aside from being a sarcastic description of Kenyan police, it's also a nickname given to Lei Wulong, the Jackie Chan tribute character from <em>Tekken</em>.</p><p>As someone who is not a rapper, I'm particularly proud of myself for the first line in the second verse, which references jinns (demons) in Islamic mythology, as well as Jin Kazama and his father Kazuya Mishima from <em>Tekken</em>, both of whom carry a genetic abnormality known as the Devil Gene that allows them to transform into their \"demonic\" alter-egos. Aside from <em>Tekken</em>, characters from <em>Dead or Alive</em>, <em>Mortal Kombat</em> and <em>Street Fighter</em> are also referenced.</p>",

The song that prompted him to ask me the question that day was \"Nairobi Tofauti\", which DJ OCS always plays when I'm introduced to the stage (maybe that'll change with the release of this album).</p><p>I wrote a script for the skit sometime after the conversation and sent it to Aman. He ended up liking it and we eventually laid it down in the studio, though he ad-libbed most of his lines to fit his own vocabulary and cadence, and even added some funny comments of his own off the top of his head; if you pay attention, you can tell when he's reading and when he's just riffing, which I feel adds to the humour of the whole thing.</p><p>The skit initially wasn't accompanied by any music, but after a while I felt that it would be difficult for a casual listener to get through, given that it was more than 3 minutes of plain dialogue. AndyBolo and I first started thinking about adding music after Aman suggested using some elements of grime and drill at points when we reference them, but that didn't really go anywhere. At home, I started playing around with the stems for \"Simama Kando\" and \"Super Police\" (both 138 BPM), and suddenly the idea of combining the two for some laid-back background music started coming together.</p>",

That one. Uh, it's a dope song, by the way. As you have told me to say. I thought it was, uh, grime, but a friend of mine told me it was actually drill. Uh, I figured you would know the difference. So, what's the difference between, uh, grime and drill?</p></div><div class=\"section\"> <p class=\"ad-lib\">DVK</p> <p>The difference between grime and drill…</p></div><div class=\"section\"> <p class=\"ad-lib\">Amandeep</p> <p>Sorry, man.

Uh, I don't know much else when it comes to this shit besides the musical stylings of Drake and Yo Yo Honey Singh.</p></div><div class=\"section\"> <p class=\"ad-lib\">DVK</p> <p>Nah, it's cool, man. Uh, it's kinda understandable 'cause drill and grime have similar tempos, but drill is generally, like, darker, or grittier than grime. Even when you pay attention to the drums, drill usually has, like, much harder-hitting drums and distinct drum patterns compared to, like, what you hear in a lot of, uh, grime music.</p></div><div class=\"section\"> <p class=\"ad-lib\">Amandeep</p> <p>Okay.</p></div><div class=\"section\"> <p class=\"ad-lib\">DVK</p> <p>Even when you look at their stylistic origins—you know, I'm educated. I have to use terms like that—uh, grime basically rose from, like, electronic music in the UK, like jungle and UK garage, whereas drill came from gangsta rap and, like, hardcore hip hop in Chicago.</p></div><div class=\"section\"> <p class=\"ad-lib\">Amandeep</p> <p>So basically, what you're trying to tell me, is grime is Babu Owino, and drill is Mike Sonko?</p></div><div class=\"section\"> <p class=\"ad-lib\">DVK</p> <p>Yeah, yeah. Like, uh, Babu Owino has a cleaner record than Sonko, but he's still crazy enough to shoot you in the neck, you know? Like, Sonko started out as a criminal, but now he's evolved and ventured into other things. Like, he's still a criminal at his core, you know?

I found the beat on BeatStars while looking for a mellow boom bap beat to follow the skit with Aman, and seeing as I told him I'd be going out with some friends afterwards, coming up with ideas for this song was fairly easy.</p><p>In many ways, this song pays homage to St. Mary's School (Saints), which I attended for all 11 years of my primary and lower secondary education. The title references a combination of a doughnut or mandazi, a samosa and a sausage that was by far the most popular snack among students during our mid-morning break time. BH later explained in the studio that the term also references certain traditional sexual practices in some Kenyan cultures, and Nigel alludes to mixing weed and alcohol in his verse, so make of the title what you will, I guess.</p><p>Given the Saints references, I felt it was only right that I feature fellow Saints alumni on the track, and that led me to Nigel and K-Spot, both of whom were in my year in primary school, left when I joined high school and I've occasionally kept in touch with since. Nigel ended up being the only one not to reference Saints in his verse outside of the song title, but I still really liked what he and Spot brought to the table. His intro is also where I got <em>Sippin' and Trippin'</em> from as the title for Part II of this album.</p><p>I wrote the outro at the end for BH to do as a segue into the next track, and I liked how he complimented the subdued nature of the beat at that point with his booming voice. His participation also made sense in that he also went to Saints; he was a year ahead of me when we were in high school.</p>",

I also knew I wanted to bring in a rapper who could match my light-hearted lyrics and the trap flows I set out to bring; I initially considered Nigel 187 since he had done similar tracks in the past, but later I went with Lilmaina instead because I felt he would do a better job of what I was going for (and also, to be frank, because the guy's been popping off with hit after hit, regardless of how much more expensive bringing him in would be).</p><p>I reached out to both Cap and Lilmaina in September 2021, and both showed interest. Cap sent me some beats which I went through, before settling on one that I wanted him to modify because I didn't think it fully matched the vibe I wanted. That process took months, to the point where Lilmaina wondered whether I'd just abandoned the song (which would be strange because I had paid him already), but eventually Cap came through after I asked him to sample \"Nimesota\" from my debut EP. In the studio, I worked with AndyBolo to add some extra sounds, and after some experimentation he fleshed out the beat nicely with sounds similar to those from \"Nimesota\", but used different instruments (like that beautiful French horn) or switched things up with some plugins.</p><p>Lilmaina came to the studio having written some of his lines but wanted time to finish his parts in the first verse, lay them down, then repeat for the second verse. Andy and I just used our phones while the beat looped and he did his thing, and we were really pleased with what he brought in the end. I'd already written the outro for him but told him to do it in a way that felt natural to him, so that part was really easy.</p>",

I actually did it while writing <em>Not a Rapper</em> in the middle of 2020 and previewed it on my Instagram in November that year, but decided to leave it off the EP because I had bigger plans for it. I always felt it could be a hit if I took my time with it, since it's a song I felt many Kenyans would relate to and enjoy.</p><p>I found the beat in a random ad while browsing drill beats on BeatStars during the writing process for <em>Not a Rapper</em>, and while I had worked with Black Hole to create new beats for the rest of the songs I wrote, I didn't want to change anything with this one because I loved the beat too much. It also just didn't fit, and I was too broke to buy the beat at the time.</p><p>To this day I'll never understand how the premise for the song and its lyrics came to mind; I simply caught a vibe while listening to the beat and this is what came out. It also served as the foundation to build out the entire story for <em>Sippin' and Trippin'</em>, so it's a bit crazy to think that a whole six tracks may never have existed had I never wrote this song.</p><p>AndyBolo's writing credit may come as a surprise given that he doesn't appear anywhere, but he's the one that had me switch things up in the first and second chorus with the \"baby girl\" and \"buda boss\" lines, respectively. He brought it up while we were recording the song and I feel like it added a little extra spice to my flow, so I decided to give him the credit.</p>",

Its premise was initially meant for a potential stand-up bit, but since I felt it would fit nicely within the story of <em>Sippin' and Trippin'</em>, I decided to turn it into a song instead.</p><p>At the time of writing the song, I had listened to Cap's recently released debut album <em>All Caps</em> about three times, so I was in a space where I wanted to tap into his production style for this song as well as \"Wake Up\". I browsed through the beats he had sent me again and settled on one, but when I asked him for the stems, he told me the beat was already taken. That drove me to explore some of his collaborators at East Side Nation (ESN), eventually settling on Jami after finding three beats on his Instagram that I really liked.</p><p>I reached out to Jami in December 2021, and he eventually responded early the following month; he said that he didn't have the stems for any of the three beats because he'd had some serious issues with his laptop. When I settled on the beat I wanted, he recreated it, sent it to me and it turned out much better than the original. Moral of the story: Sometimes setbacks give you the opportunity to do something even better than before.</p><p>Around the same time I found Jami's beats, I was also thinking about getting a woman to tell in her own words what goes through a woman's mind when she's in her ovulation period and feeling hornier than usual. I'd recently discovered Groovy Jo's music and liked the bad bitch energy she brought on her song \"Big Ole Big Booty\", so I decided to look no further and reach out. I was really impressed with what she came up with and her decision to respond to my verse, rather than simply retelling it from her perspective (or rather the perspective of the older woman Lilmaina calls at the end of \"Wake Up\", which is what I initially envisioned).</p><p>The idea for the sample at the end came on the morning of my last studio session for the album and getting Ty's blessing to use it was easy, since I'd already gotten to know him through stand-up.</p>",

While I'd only ever thought about the song in terms of how it ends the story for <em>Sippin' and Trippin'</em>, AndyBolo pointed out after we recorded it that he also sees it as a fun way of highlighting real sexual health struggles and situations that many young Kenyans go through and can relate to. It's only fitting then that he was the one who came up with the warning in the chorus that he recorded himself: \"Ogopa STD!\"</p><p>I wrote this song to a Congolese-style afro drill beat I found on BeatStars, and that gave me the idea of having G'zay work on a benga/rhumba drill beat, which he really liked when I first pitched it to him. For the guitar sample, I first reached out to a guitarist I found on YouTube called Blessed Ben, but things didn't quite pan out with him. I later reached out to a producer called Ben Theuri, who I'd been following on Instagram for a little while, and while (in his own words) he had never worked on anything benga/rhumba before, he took some time to do his research, and eventually hit an absolute home run with the sample. With the new beat and its different feel, I had to make some adjustments to the lyrics and rewrite the outro, but most of the lyrics remained the same.</p><p>While I was plotting on featuring Lilmaina on \"Wake Up\", I also thought about having him use the silly voice he does on some of his videos for some ad-libs I had already recorded, which I felt would add to its light-hearted feel. He did his thing brilliantly in the studio once we were done with \"Wake Up\" and I'm really happy with how it turned out in the end.</p>",

Black Hole had created a new beat for it as they had done with the rest of the songs on that project, but after dropping it, I always felt a desire to re-release it with the beat I wrote it to. I'd been browsing through drill beats on YouTube when I landed on this absolute banger that Saint Cardona had made.</p><p>As a kid from a middle-class background, I felt that I wouldn't be able to do the song and its subject matter justice by myself, so I started thinking about who I could bring in for a more \"ghetto\" perspective. My initial target was Smady Tings, who I've always considered the most lyrically adept member of Mbogi Genje, but at the time the fee their manager was demanding was too much for me.</p><p>After thinking through my options further, I realised I didn't even have to go that far when an old rapper friend of my brother's was around, so pretty much as soon as that occurred to me, I reached out to Vktor Mirage (who went by GuyMoja at the time). I was very familiar with his ability to tell stories from the hood in his music, and although I'd never heard him rhyme on a drill beat at that point, I never doubted his ability to deliver.</p>",

            "synopsis": "<p>Between this song and \"Nairobi Tofauti\", I've never been able to decide which one is my favourite from <em>Not a Rapper</em>. I really like this song as well because it was so fun to write, and I've always felt that other people with a similar upbringing to mine would especially be able to have fun with it. Like with \"Nairobi Tofauti\", I had long felt an urge to re-release this song with the beat I wrote it to.</p><p>Unlike \"Nairobi Tofauti\", however, I had to re-record this song in my bedroom because I didn't have the acapella track for it; AndyBolo had put in the acapella track for \"Safari-con Remake\" instead by mistake when he sent me the final masters for <em>Not a Rapper</em>. I saw that as an opportunity to match the vibe of the original beat I wrote it to, and I was thoroughly pleased with the result.</p><p>My inspiration for the flow on the second verse came from \"Meet the Woo\" by the late New York rapper Pop Smoke. He raps in a similar fashion towards the end of his verse and since I had been listening to a lot of his music when I wrote <em>Not a Rapper</em>, it's no surprise that he ended up being an influence on this song as he has been on countless other drill tracks.</p><p>S'Bling did a superb job with the beat by the way. It still kinda surprises me that a Nigerian man living in the Ukraine could produce something like that, also bearing in mind that he's made himself known primarily for making afrobeats.</p>",
